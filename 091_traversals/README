For this problem, you will be taking a sequence of numbers, adding them
to a BST (by hand), and then performing each of the standard
three traversals (pre-order, in-order, and post-order) to print out the
tree's contents.  For this problem, there are three trees. You will
write the answer for each tree into a separate file (answer1.txt, answer2.txt,
and answer3.txt).  In each file, you will write the results of each traversal
on the appropriate line (one traversal per line), with the items separated by spaces.
For the third tree, you will also delete a few items before you perform your traversals.
For deletions of nodes with two children, select the left-most right child (right
once, then all the way left) as the replacement.

For example, if we added 2, 1, and 3 to the tree, your answer file would look like:

Preorder: 2 1 3
Inorder: 1 2 3
Postorder: 1 3 2



==========================

Tree 1:  7 2 5 6 1 9 3

Tree 2:  33 44 12 55 99 16 77 0 -1 100

Tree 3:  2 4 1 7 3 9 -1 88 17 -23 16 44 77
         Then delete 2, 16, -1.
