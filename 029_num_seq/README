Numeric Sequences:
==================

For this assignment, you are going to write some code
to work with numeric sequences.  This assignment
is broken down into 3 steps, each of which will
be done in a different file.  Each step has
a few functions that you should write in it.
You should write one function, test it,
commit to git, then move on to the next one.

When you finish, be sure to commit all the
working versions of your files, then run
the grade command.

If you run out of time, be sure to commit
a version of yoru code which has as much working
as possible, then run grade.

NOTE: You will NOT receive a grade instantly.
This assignment has a hard deadline, and you will
receive a grade ONCE after it.  There is no
regrading.

Be sure that all of your code compiles
with these options:
 -std=gnu99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic

******Step 1 [30 points]*****
   For this step, you will work in step1.c
Open step1.c in emacs, and you will find that 
it is blank, except for one comment.

***Step 1(A): Declare a function in step1.c
called "seq1", which returns an int
and takes one int (called x) as a parameter.

The seq1 function should compute and return
the x'th element of the sequence shown below:

x        0  1  2  3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
seq1(x) -3  1  5  9  13  17  21  25  29  33  37


Note that the seq1 function should *return* this value,
it should not print it (nor anything else).

Note also that your function should work correctly
for numbers less than or greater than those
shown here.  Here is what you should get for
some negative values of x:

x        -4  -3   -2  -1
seq1(x) -19 -15  -11  -7

**Step 1(B): Write a main function which tests
your seq1 function.  You should use this to check
that your seq1 works correctly.  We will test your
main function to ensure that it calls seq1 multiple
times (you need more than 1 test case!), and prints
the results. However,we will not check which particular 
cases it tests.  The format you should use to print
each test case should be

"seq1(%d) = %d\n"

where the first %d is the parameter to seq1 (i.e., x),
and the second %d is the result of seq1(x).

**Step 1(C): Write the function "printSeq1Range"
which returns void, and takes two ints, "low"
and "high" as parameters. 

This function should print the values of seq1(x)
for all xs between low (inclusive) and high (exclusive).
These values should be separated by a comma, and
there should be a newline at the end of the line.

For example printSeq1Range(0,4) should print

-3,1,5,9

Notice that the items are separated by commas,
but there is no extra comma at the end.  If you want
full credit on this problem, do not print an extra
comma at the end.  If you print an extra comma
at the end, you will only receive partial credit.

Other examples of the output of this function are:

printSeq1Range(-2,6) would print

-11,-7,-3,1,5,9,13,17

and printSeq1Range(7,3) would print



[that is, a blank line, as there is nothing
 in the range from 7 to 3]. Note that
printSeq1Range(0,0) would also print a blank line
(just "\n").

**Step 1(D):  Add to your main to test printSeq1Range.
You should call this multiple times.  You should
also not remove your tests from Step 1(B) for
seq1, since we will check for those.  As before,
we do not care what specific cases you test,
although we expect you will test multiple cases.

For each test case, you should print

"printSeq1Range(%d,%d)\n"

where the %ds are the parameters to printSeq1Range 
(inorder: low, then high).  After you print this
line, you should call printSeq1Range(low, high),
which will print its own results.

*********Step 2 [33 points]**********
  For this step, you will work in step2.c 
Open step2.c in emacs, and you will find that it
is blank, except for one comment.


****Step 2(A): Declare a function in step2.c called "seq2"
which returns an int, and takes one int (called x)
as a parameter.

The seq2 function should compute and return the x'th
element of the sequence shown below:

x        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9  10  11  12  13  14
seq2(x)  1  5 11 19 29 41 55 71 89 109 131 155 181 209 239

Note that the seq2 function should *return* this value,
it should not print it (nor anything else).

Note also that your function should work correctly
for numbers less than or greater than those
shown here.  Here is what you should get for
some negative values of x:

x      -4  -3  -2   -1
seq2(x) 5   1  -1   -1

  

***Step 2(B): Write a main function which tests
your seq2 function.  You should use this to check
that your seq2 works correctly.  We will test your
main function to ensure that it calls seq2 multiple
times (you need more than 1 test case!), and prints
the results. However,we will not check which particular 
cases it tests.  The format of each test case should be

"seq2(%d) = %d\n"

where the first %d is the parameter to seq2,
and the second %d is the result of seq2.

***Step 2(C): Write a function called "sumSeq2"
which returns an int, and takes two ints
as parameters: "low" and "high".

This function should sum the values of
seq2(x) for xs ranging from low (inclusive)
to high (exclusive). 

For example, 
sumSeq2(0,2) should return 6 (because 1 + 5 = 6) 
sumSeq2(3,6) should return 89 (because 19 + 29 + 41 = 89)
sumSeq2(9,7) should return 0, because low is less than high,
             so there are no elements in that range.

***Step 2(D): Add to your main to test sumSeq2
(do not remove your tests for seq2---keep them there!).
Again, we will check that your main calls sumSeq2,
and that it prints the results, but we are not particular
about what test cases you use.  The format for each
test case should be

"sumSeq2(%d, %d) = %d\n"

where the first two %ds are the parameters to
sumSeq2 (in order: low, then high), and the last
%d is the result of sumSeq2(low,high).


*******Step 3 [37 points]******
   For this step, you will work in step3.c
Open step3.c in emacs, and you will find that 
it is blank, except for one comment.

***Step 3(A): Declare a function in step3.c called "seq3"
which returns an int, and takes two ints (called x and y)
as parameters.

The values for seq3(x,y) are shown in the table
below, with x values being listed at the top
of each column, and y values being listed
at the left of each row.  The corresponding
entry in the table is the value of seq3(x,y).
                    x
      -5 -4 -3 -2 -1   0   1   2   3   4   5
    +---------------------------------------
 -5 | 30 22 14  6 -2 -10 -18 -26 -34 -42 -50
 -4 | 27 20 13  6 -1  -8 -15 -22 -29 -36 -43
 -3 | 24 18 12  6  0  -6 -12 -18 -24 -30 -36
 -2 | 21 16 11  6  1  -4  -9 -14 -19 -24 -29
 -1 | 18 14 10  6  2  -2  -6 -10 -14 -18 -22
y 0 | 15 12  9  6  3   0  -3  -6  -9 -12 -15
  1 | 12 10  8  6  4   2   0  -2  -4  -6  -8
  2 |  9  8  7  6  5   4   3   2   1   0  -1
  3 |  6  6  6  6  6   6   6   6   6   6   6
  4 |  3  4  5  6  7   8   9  10  11  12  13
  5 |  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  20

For example, seq3(-4,-5) is 22, which you can
see by looking at the column with -4 above it
(for the x value) and the row with -5 to
its left (for the y value), and then seeing
that the value in the table there is 22.

As always, this sequence continues in both directions
for both x and y, so your seq3 function should be
able to handle larger and smaller values of both
parameters than shown here.

***Step 3(B):  Write a main to test your seq3 function.
As before, we expect you to call the function more
than once and print the results.  The format
for each test case should be

"seq3(%d, %d) = %d\n"

where the first two %ds are the parameters to
seq3 in order (x, then y) and the last is the result
of seq3(x,y).

**Step 3(C): Write the function "countEvenInSeq3Range"
which returns and int and takes 4 ints
(xLow, xHi, yLow, yHi) as parameters.

This function should count how many values
of seq3(x,y) are even when x ranges from xLow (inclusive)
to xHi (exclusive) and y ranges from yLow (inclusive)
to yHi (exclusive).  If either [xLow, xHi)
or [yLow, yHi) is empty, this function should return 0
(as there are no even numbers in an empty range).

For example, countEvenInSeq3Range(0,2,0,3) should
return 4 because the following values are even:
seq3(0,0) is 0
seq3(0,1) is 2
seq3(1,1) is 0
seq3(0,2) is 4
(The other values in that range are -3 and 3 which are odd).

**Step 3(D):  Add test cases for countEvenInSeq3Range
to your main.  As before, do not remove
the test cases for seq3, test on any cases
that you want.  Print the results
with the format:

"countEvenInSeq3Range(%d, %d, %d, %d) = %d\n"

Where the first four %ds are the parameters
to countEvenInSeq3Range (in order: xLow,
xHigh, yLow, yHi), and the last is the result
of countEvenInSeq3Range.
