As always, read and understand Chapter 21, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".


1. Which of the following is not a common type of linked list?

A. singly linked
B. double linked
C. circular 
D. measurable
E. None of the above (all are common types of linked lists)

2. What can you add to your linked list class to make the
   "add to back" operation more efficient?

A. previous pointers 
B. skip pointers 
C. a tail pointer
D. a backup list pointer
E. None of the above

3. AoP describes a common novice problem in writing
   linked list destructors.  What type of memory allocation
   error is this problem?

A. Double free/delete
B. Freeing/deleting a pointer not returned by malloc/new
C. Use of memory after it has been freed/deleted
D. Memory Leak
E. None of the above

4. AoP describes three ways to insert in sorted order, 
   and to remove a particular node.  One of these is to find a pointer 
   to the node before you want  to remove.  Why is this approach not so
   good?

A. It runs in O(N^2) time, while the others run in O(N) time.
B. It makes special cases where the other algorithms do not.
C. It exhibits worse cache behavior relative to the other algorithms.
D. You should always use recursion if you can.
E. None of the above

5. If you use a recursive solutions to insert in sorted order or
   remove a particular node, what do you need to do with the return value
   of the recursive call in the helper function?

A. Ignore it
B. Set it equal to NULL
C. free/delete it
D. Set the current node's next pointer to it
E. None of the above

6. AoP shows how to use what feature of C++ to avoid code
   duplication between remove and removeAllOccurences?

A. templates
B. subtype polymorphism
C. exceptions
D. iostreams
E. references
F. None of the above

7. With respect to linked lists, iterators provide a nice combination
   of which two desireable features?

A. Easy debugging and short functions/methods
B. Documentation and code re-use
C. Testing and readability
D. Abstraction and performance
E. None of the above

8. C++'s std::list is what kind of list?

A. singly linked
B. doubly linked
C. circular 
D. measurable
E. None of the above 


9. What method in std::list would you use to get
   an iterator which refers to the start of the list?

A. .begin()
B. .start_iterator()
C. .iterator()
D. .start()
E. None of the above

10. What method in std::list would you use to add 
    an element to the end of the list?

A. .add_back()
B. .add()
C. .push_back()
D. .pop_back()
E. .end()
F. None of the above

11.  Suppose you have an iterator (it) which
     refers to an element in a std::list (lst).
     You want to remove the element that it 
     refers to from lst.  What would you write?

A. it.remove();
B. delete it;
C. lst.delete(it);
D. lst.erase(it);
E. None of the above

12. After doing correct action for question 11, which
    iterators are invalidated?

A. All iterators on all std::lists
B. All iterators on all std::lists which are instantiated
   on the same type for the template parameter.
C. All iterators on the specific std::list from
   which the element was removed.
D. All iterators which reference the removed element,
   or the element immediately before or after it.
E. All iterators which reference the removed element.
F. Only the particular iterator which was used to
   remove the element (it)
G. No iterators are invalidated
H. None of the above
