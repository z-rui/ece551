As always, read and understand Chapter 23, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. If a hash table with N elements  is well designed and implemented (i.e., 
   has a good hash function, is appropriately sized, etc), then you
   would expect accesses to it to have what runtime?

A. O(1)
B. O(lg(N))
C. O(N)
D. O(N^2)
E. O(2^N)
F. O(N!)
G. None of the above

For the next two questions, consider the following line of
code which has had a typename replaced by TYPE, and a binary
operator replaced by OP:
     TYPE bucket =   hash(key) OP num_buckets;

2. What operator should OP be so taht this line of code
   determines the bucket which the key goes into?
A. +
B. -
C. *
D. /
E. %
F. &
G. |
H. ^
I. <
J. None of the above

3. What is the most correct type for TYPE?
   [Hint: think about what you will use the variable 'bucket' for]

A. char * 
B. const char * 
C. int
D. char
E. unsigned char.
F. size_t
G. ssize_t
H. void *
I. None of the above

4. What is "rehashing"?

A. When you find that a bucket is already occupied, so you
   compute a variant of the hash function to find a new bucket.
B. When the load factor exceeds a threshold, so you increase
   the number of buckets and reinsert all elements.
C. When you determine that your hash function is poor for your
   dataset, so you alter your hash function while the program is runnign.
D. When you compute hash(hash(key)) instead of hash(key).
E. None of the above

5. If you write a program which works with passwords, how should you store them?

A. Store the passwords directly.
B. Hash the passwords.
C. Add pepper to the passwords, then store them.
D. Salt the passwords, then hash them. Store the salt and the hash.
E. Salt and pepper the passwords, then hash. Store the salt and hash, but not the pepper.
F. Smothered, covered, cappped.
G. One provelone without.
H. None of the above.

6. How good or bad is this hash function for strings?

unsigned hash(const std::string & str) {
  unsigned ans = 0;
  for ( std::string::const iterator it=str.begin();
        it!=str.end(); 
        ++it) {
    ans += * it;
  }
  return ans ;
}

A. It is not a valid hash function.
B. It is valid, but not a good choice.
C. It is valid, and is decent, but not great.
D. It is a good hash function.
E. It is a cryptographically secure hash function.

7. What is external chaining?

A. A collision resolution scheme in which a fixed ammount is added
   to the bucket number until an empty bucket is found.
B. A collision resolution scheme in which an increasing ammount is added
   to the bucket number until an empty bucket is found.
C. A collision resolution scheme in which linked lists are used
   to hold all colliding elements in a bucket.
D. A colliding resolution scheme in which the element being
   collided with is removed.
E. None of the above.

8. What is linear probing?

A. A collision resolution scheme in which a fixed ammount is added
   to the bucket number until an empty bucket is found.
B. A collision resolution scheme in which an increasing ammount is added
   to the bucket number until an empty bucket is found.
C. A collision resolution scheme in which linked lists are used
   to hold all colliding elements in a bucket.
D. A colliding resolution scheme in which the element being
   collided with is removed.
E. None of the above.
