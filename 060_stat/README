In this assignment, you will be producing your own, simplified version
of the UNIX utility "stat", which provides information about a file.

Before you get started, try out "stat" on some files.  For example,
you might do "stat README" and get something like (but not exactly) this:

  File: ‘README’
  Size: 196		Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fc00h/64512d	Inode: 801835      Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1001/    drew)   Gid: ( 1001/    drew)
Access: 2016-05-30 12:12:12.020211296 -0400
Modify: 2016-05-30 12:12:12.020211296 -0400
Change: 2016-05-30 12:12:12.024211870 -0400
 Birth: -

You can see how big the file is, that it is a regular file, the permissions,
who owns it, and when it was accessed (among other things).

If you were to do stat on a directory (e.g., "stat ."), you would
get information about the directory:

  File: ‘.’
  Size: 4096		Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory
Device: fc00h/64512d	Inode: 801832      Links: 2
Access: (0775/drwxrwxr-x)  Uid: ( 1001/    drew)   Gid: ( 1001/    drew)
Access: 2016-05-30 12:12:14.044278298 -0400
Modify: 2016-05-30 12:13:51.183029783 -0400
Change: 2016-05-30 12:13:51.183029783 -0400
 Birth: -

Notice that now the type is "directory".  
There are other types of files, which you could see if you were to do, e.g.,
"stat /dev/null"

  File: ‘/dev/null’
  Size: 0		Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   character special file
Device: 5h/5d		Inode: 6872        Links: 1     Device type: 1,3
Access: (0666/crw-rw-rw-)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
Access: 2016-05-27 06:55:17.993993052 -0400
Modify: 2016-05-27 06:55:17.993993052 -0400
Change: 2016-05-27 06:55:17.993993052 -0400

You can learn more about "stat" by reading "man stat".  However, note that
the real stat utility has many features that you will NOT be implementing.

The other thing you will want to know a bit about before starting
is how the stat utility gets this information about a file.  It uses
(and you will use) the system call "lstat" which asks the operating
system to give the program metadata about a requested file.

As we proceed, you will want to make frequent reference to 

  man lstat

It may seem overwhelmingly long at first, but you will work through this
in small steps.  Also note that this man page has an example of how to use
the "stat" system call at the end (and "lstat" is used in exactly the same
way).

One thing to be mindful of when reading this manpage is that it
appears to have many unfamiliar types (dev_t, ino_t, mode_t, nlink_t, etc),
but they are generally just typedefs for an appropriately sized "int" (most are
"long unsigned int").

Now you are ready to start writing your program.  Your ultimate
goal is to write a program called "mystat" which replicates the 
functionality of the "stat" command without any options (that is, 
you aren't going to do -t, -c, etc).  If you run "stat something"
and "mystat something" they should produce exactly the same output.

We have provided mystat.c, which has some #includes in it,
as well as one function for Step 4.

**Step 1 [20 points]
  Your first goal is to make your mystat program accept exactly ONE
  filename as a command line argument, and print out the first
  THREE lines of the output that "stat" would print for that file.

For example, "mystat README" might produce output like this:

  File: ‘README’
  Size: 2825		Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fc00h/64512d	Inode: 801829      Links: 1

To avoid issues figuring out exactly how the whitespace is formatted, here are the correct
format strings for printf for these three lines:

  "  File: ‘%s’\n"       
  "  Size: %-10lu\tBlocks: %-10lu IO Block: %-6lu %s\n"
  "Device: %lxh/%lud\tInode: %-10lu  Links: %lu\n"

Note that stat uses ‘’ around the filename in the first line, not '', and you should too.
In the second line:
  - The first % conversion is the total size, in bytes
   (look at man lstat to figure out what to pass as the converted argument).  
  - The second % conversion is the number of 512B blocks allocated to the file (again, see man lstat)
  - The third % conversion is the blocksize for filesystem I/O
  - The fourth % conversion is a description of the file type.
   The file type is some of the bits in the st_mode field ( AND it with S_IFMT).
   You can compare that result to several defined constants to figure out what
   to print:

    S_IFBLK  -> "block special file"
    S_IFCHR  -> "character special file"
    S_IFDIR  -> "directory"
    S_IFIFO  -> "fifo"
    S_IFLNK  -> "symbolic link"
    S_IFREG  -> "regular file"
    S_IFSOCK -> "socket"

In the third line:
  - The first and second % conversions are the ID of the device containing the file
  - The third % conversion is the inode number
  - The fourth % conversion is the number of hard links.


Implement and test that before proceeding (hint: abstract things out
into functions!).
    - Do NOT "grade" yet.  You only get to grade once for this assignment.
    - DO git commit often as you make progress.
       - If you run low on time with a broken mess, you can go back to
         to an old commit which has working code.

**Step 2 [20 points]
  Your next goal is to add part of the the FOURTH line of output from stat.  This line
might look like:

Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1001/    drew)   Gid: ( 1001/    drew)

However, you are only going to do the "Access" part in this step, 
so use this format string for now:

 "Access: (%04o/%s)\n"


The two percent conversions in this steps are:
  (1) The permissions in octal.  These come from st_mode & ~S_IFMT.
      (That is, all the bits of st_mode except the ones for the file
       type).
  (2) The human readable description of the permissions (plus
      one character for file type).  This string always has 10 characters:

        - The first is either 'b','c', 'd', 'p', 'l', '-', or 's' depending 
          on the file type (corresponding to S_IFBLK, S_IFCHR, S_IFDIR, S_IFIFO, 
          S_IFLNK, S_IFREG, S_IFSOCK in that order)
        - The second is either 'r' or '-' depending on if the file
          is readable by the owner.   To figure this out, 
          look at st_mode & S_IRUSR.  If that value is non-zero,
          the owner has read permission, and you should put 'r' here.
          Otherwise, the owner cannot read it, and you should put '-' here.
        - The third is either 'w' or '-' depending on if the file
          is writeable able by the owner.  This is similar to the
          previous, but the bit to check is S_IWUSR.
        - The fourth is either 'x' or '-' depending on if the
          file is executable by the owner (S_IXUSR)
        - The next three (5,6,7) are similar to the previous
          three, but for the group rather than the owner.
          They will be r/-, w/-, and x/- based on 
          S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, and S_IXGRP respectively.
        - The next three (8,9,10) follow the same pattern,
          but with S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, and S_IXOTH  (for "other"
          instead of user/group).

Test and commit before proceeding!

**Step 3 [20 points]
Now you will finish this fourth line.  The format string for
the full line is:

 "Access: (%04o/%s)  Uid: (%5d/%8s)   Gid: (%5d/%8s)\n"

You have already done the first two conversion (from Step 2).
The remaining ones to implement are:
  (3) The user ID of the owner, as a number.
  (4) This string is the name of the owner.  You will need to use

          struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid);
 
      to look up the user's name from their uid.  See "man getpwuid"
      for information about "struct passwd", so you can find out
      how to get the user name out of it.
  (5) The group ID of the owning group, as a number.
  (6) This string is the group name of the owning group.  You will need to
      use

          struct group *getgrgid(gid_t gid); 

      to look up the group's name from their gid.  See "man getgrgid".

As always, test and commit before proceeding!

***Step 4 [10 points]
Now you are going to add the last four lines of output:


Access: 2016-05-30 12:21:34.372150942 -0400
Modify: 2016-05-30 12:58:49.647474442 -0400
Change: 2016-05-30 12:58:49.647474442 -0400
 Birth: -

which use the following format strings:
  "Access: %s\n";
  "Modify: %s\n";
  "Change: %s\n";
  " Birth: -\n";


For the first three of these, we have provided the time2str
function, which formats the time for you.  If "sbuf" is your
struct stat, you can call this function like this:


  char *timestr =   time2str(timestr, 
                             &sbuf.st_atime, 
                             sbuf.st_atim.tv_nsec);

This call will fill in timestr with the formatted time for the 
access time.  You can then print timestr out.  Note that
time2str mallocs its answer, so you need to free it.

Note that for each of the files (st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime),
there is also an st_atim.tv_nsec, st_mtim.tv_nsec, and st_ctim.tv_nsec
[where these do not have an 'e' on the end of 'time'].  These
are described in the notes at the bottom of the man pages.

Note that for "Birth" you will always just produce "-",
as "stat" does too.

Test and commit before proceeding!


**Step 5 [10 points]

 Up to this point, your program has taken ONE command line argument,
 however, the real stat program takes an arbitrary number of arguments,
 and stats each one.  For example, you can run "stat README . /dev/null"
 and it will print the information for all three files one after
 the other. 

 For this step, change your program so that it accept any number
 of arguments on the command line, and print information for each of them.

Test and commit before proceeding!

**Step 6 [10 points]

  If you run "mystat /dev/null" and "stat /dev/null" you will notice
  a difference in the third line of output:

stat:   Device: 5h/5d  Inode: 6872        Links: 1     Device type: 1,3
mystat: Device: 5h/5d  Inode: 6872        Links: 1

Your goal in this step is to fix this discrepancy, by checking
if the file you stated is a device (either the S_ISCHR or the S_ISBLK macro
returns true), and if so, using the following format for the third line:

   "Device: %lxh/%lud\tInode: %-10lu  Links: %-5lu Device type: %d,%d\n"

These two new % conversions are for the "major" and "minor" numbers of the
file's device ID. As "man lstat" explains, the "major" and "minor" functions
are useful for splitting a device number into these two components.

**Step 7 [10 points]

  The final discrepancy between "mystat" and "stat" is in the first  
  line of output if the file is a symbolic link.  In particular,
  stat prints and -> and the target of the link, whereas mystat
  does not (yet).

stat:   File: ‘/dev/fd’ -> ‘/proc/self/fd’
mystat: File: ‘/dev/fd’

  In this final step, you will make mystat check if the
  file is a symbolic link (use the S_ISLNK macro), and if so,
  use the following format: 

   "  File: ‘%s’ -> ‘%s’\n"

  To get the target of the link (that is, what the symbolic link
  is a link to), use 

       ssize_t readlink(const char *path, char *buf, size_t bufsiz);

  which you can read about in "man -S2 readlink".

  Note that readlink does *NOT* null terminate the buffer that it fills
  in, so you will need to do that.  You can figure out where to put
  the null terminator character ('\0') based on the size returned 
  from readlink (it will tell you how many character it put in.

  You should make the output string have space for
  256 characters, and can call readlink like this:

   char linktarget[256];
   ssize_t len = readlink(fname, linktarget, 256);
   //you should then write some code here to add a null terminator!

   //after you do that, linktarget is the string you can print

Once you finish all of these steps, and have tested your code
(and it valgrinds cleanly), commit it, push it, and grade it.

NOTE: we have provided a script called "test.sh" which takes one command
line arugment, and runs your stat, runs the real stat, and diffs the output.
You should use this to make sure that your output matches the real stat
for a variety of test cases before you submit!
