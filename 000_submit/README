This problem is just for you to practice using
the assignment submission system.

(0) First, look at your grades
  
     view-grades

  You will see that this assignment (000_submit) is available, and has no grade yet.
  You may also want to try running

    status
  
  which will tell you what gradings/releases are in progress, as
  well as information about assignments due soon.

  Now do the "assignment".
(1) Create a file called "myNetID.txt"  (inside this directory)
(2) Write one line, containing your netID in that file
(3) Add it to git
  git add myNetID.txt
(4) Commit it to git
  git commit 
(5) Push your commits to the remote repository (i.e., turn it in)
  git push
(6) Grade the assignment
  grade 000_submit
(7) See what grade you got
  view-grades
 
  It may take a minute for your assignment to be graded (in which case, please be patient)
  Once it is graded, and you have passed, you will see that there is another assignment listed
  (001_ch01rq) with no grade---passing assignments releases other assignments.

(8) Obtain the new assignment, and your detailed grade reports by pulling from git

  git pull

   You should get a file called "grade.txt" which will contain details about your score 
   (there isn't much to say for this assignment).
   You should also have another directory 001_ch01rq (cd ../001_ch01rq) which is your
   reading quiz for chapter 1.  Now go do that assignment.
