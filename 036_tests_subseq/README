For this assignment, you will be writing testcases for
your next assignment (as usual, the instructions for that assignment
can be found in next-README).

As usual, one correct and many broken implementations can be found
in /usr/local/ece551/subseq.

As with power, these are provided as compiled object files, and you
should write a C program (in test-subseq.c) whose main function tests
the maxSeq function. As before, it should exit with EXIT_SUCCESS if all
tests pass, and EXIT_FAILURE if any test fails.  We have provided
run_all.sh to help you run your test cases against all implementations.
