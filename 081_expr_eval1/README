In this program,  you will be practicing using inheritance,
virtual methods, and method overriding to complete a 
simple "calculator" program, which accepts input in "prefix notation".
That is, rather than entering "4 + 3" you would enter "(+ 4 3)"

We are going to split this problem into 3 parts.

This part: Expressions are limited to numbers and pluses.  
           We don't actually evaluate the expressions, just print them back out
Next part: We add *, -, and /, but still don't evaluate
Last part: We add expression evaluation.


I have written code for you (in expr.cpp) which reads the
input, parses it, and makes "Expression" objects appropriately.
You should not need to modify this code at all (Note: there are three
different versions of it for the three problems.).


Instead, what you will write for this is the implementation of the "Expression"
class and its sub-classes which will represent the math expression that gets
read in, as well as provide a way to print it "normally" (in infix notation: 4+5)
and evaluate it to an integer.


Your code must have the following classes, with the following functionality
(that is, the parsing code relies on these classes existing, with these names,
the various Expression types being subtype compatible with Expression, and
the classes having the methods and constructors noted below):

*** This part ****
 - class Expression
    std::string toString() const = 0;  //abstract method
   
 - class NumExpression, which must be a subclass of Expression
    A constructor: NumExpression(long) 
    std::string toString() const //actually implement it

 - class PlusExpression, which must be a subclass of Expression
    A constructor: PlusExpression(Expression * lhs, Expression * rhs)
    std::string toString() const //actually implement it

*** Next part ****
 - class MinusExpression, which must be a subclass of Expression
    A constructor: MinusExpression(Expression * lhs, Expression
 * rhs)
    std::string toString() const //actually implement it

 - class TimesExpression, which must be a subclass of Expression
    A constructor: TimesExpression(Expression * lhs, Expression * rhs)
    std::string toString() const //actually implement it

 - class DivExpression, which must be a subclass of Expression
    A constructor: DivExpression(Expression * lhs, Expression * rhs)
    std::string toString() const //actually implement it

*** Last part ****

Add to Expression    
   long evaluate() const = 0; //abstract method
 
and implement it in the subclasses of Expression.


You may wish to add other classes or methods as you wish.
The various expression types must be a subclass of Expression, but do not
have to extend it directly: if you see similarity between some of these
classes that you wish to pull out into another class "in between" Expression
and those classes, you are welcome (and encouraged) to.  

You will want to implement a lot of this functionality by overriding methods
and relying on dynamic dispatch.

A few concrete details:

 1. Expression representation:  An expression (+ E1 E2) will result in
    a new PlusExpression with E1 as its lhs (first argument to the constructor),
    and E2 as its rhs (second argument to the constructor).  This is similar
    for MinusExpression, TimesExpression, and DivExpression.

    A number (like 9 or -27) will resultin a new NumExpression being created,
    with the numeric value of that number passed as the argument to the constructor.

 2. The parser etc will never make a copy or assign objects by value.  You do not
    need to worry about operator= or the copy constructor.  Each expression
    object will be created with "new", and will be referenced by at most
    one other Expression object (as either the lhs or rhs of a +,-,*, or /).

 3. When an expression is destructed, it is responsible for destructing any
    "sub expressions" (its lhs or rhs) if it has them (Plus, Minus, Times, 
    and Div Expressions).

 4. The toString function should return a string representation of the
    Expression in infix notation (that is, if the input is "(+ 4 5)" it should
    return "(4 + 5)".  Note that for Plus, Minus, Times, and Div, it is difficult
    to figure out where () are truly needed, you should put them around the output
    always.  So "(+ (+ 4 5) 7)" will result in "((4 + 5) + 7)"

 5. You will declare your classes in expr.h.  You can just implement the
    methods inside the class, or you can implement them in expr.cpp if you wish.

 6. I have provided you with a sample_input.txt, and sample_output.txt
    which show sample inputs and the output you should produce respectively.
    I have also included invalid_inputs.txt and invalid_output.txt which show
    some invalid inputs (which the parser handles) and the resulting output.
    Note that parser handles the error cases here, but you should make sure
    that you do not leak memory on the invalid_inputs.txt when the 
    parser cleans up.

HINTS
=====
These are a few things that I did in my implementation of this, which you
may find useful to at least think about, if not do.  You are free to do or not
do these as you see fit.  You might talk them over with your partner.

  - My Expression class is abstract, and all of the functions in it are abstract

  - I have one more abstract class that I put in my inheritance hierarchy.
    This class has some fields which would otherwise appear in each of its subclasses. 
    This class adds one more abstract method which I make use of in toString.
    With this approach, I implement toString once in this class, and do not
    need to override it in any of its subclasses.

  - A PlusExpression would evaluate itself by evaluating its lefthand side,
    evaluating its right hand side, and then adding the two results together
    to get its answer.

  - Think about how your objects will get destructed. Note that 
    the static type of pretty much everything in the parsing/printing code
    is Expression * 

  - stringstream is very nice for implementing toString
