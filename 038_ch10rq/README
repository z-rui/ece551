As always, read and understand Chapter 10, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. Consider the following loop, which iterates over a string s,
   but has a condition missing:

 while( /* SOMETHING MISSING */ ) {
    //do some stuff with *s
    s++;
 }

What condition should go in place of /* SOMETHING MISSING */ to
make the loop iterate over every character of the string?

A. s != NULL
B. s != '\0'
C. s != ""
D. *s != NULL
E. *s != '\0'
F. *s != ""
G. &s != NULL
H. &s != '\0'
I. &s != ""

2. If you have


   /* SOME TYPE */  s = "A string literal";

 what is the proper type for s (where /* SOME TYPE */ is)?

A. char
B. const char
C. int
D. char *
E. const char *
F. char * const
G. int *
H. const int *
I. int * const
J. const char * const *

3. Suppose you did not pick the most correct type to replace /* SOME TYPE */
   above, but instead, you picked a type which compiled and permitted the follo\
wing
   line of code:

  *s = 'B';

What would happen when this code executed?

A. s would now point at the string "B string literal".
B. s would now point at the string "B".
C. s would now point "A string literalB".
D. The program would crash.

4. How should you see if two strings (s1 and s2) have the same contents?

A. s1 == s2
B. s1[0] == s2[0]
C. *s1 == *s2
D. !strcmp(s1, s2)
E. None of the above

5. What does s1 = s2; do?

A. Makes s1 be a copy of s2
B. Copies the first letter of s2 into the first letter of s1.
C. Makes s1 be a copy of s2, but only if s1 already points at enough
   space to hold all characters in s2. Otherwise, behavior is undefined.
D. Makes s1 point at the same memory location as s2.
E. It is not legal: will give a compiler error.
F. It will cause the program to crash.

6.  Suppose we had a function readStringFromUser(), which
    reads a string from the user, and we do

char * s = readStringFromUser();
int x = (int) s;
printf("%d\n", x);

You compile and run the code, and the user types in "42"

Which of the following will it print?

A. 42
B. -42
C. 0
D. None of the above.


For the next 3 questions, suppose you declared :

int myMatrix[3][4] = { {0, 1, 2, 3},
                       {4, 5, 6, 7},
                       {8, 9, 10, 11} };

7. What is the value of myMatrix[1][2] ?

A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
F. 5
G. 6
H. 7
I. 8
J. 9
K. 10
L. 11

8. If you did

int * p = myMatrix[2];

then what would be the value of p[1] ?

A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
F. 5
G. 6
H. 7
I. 8

J. 9
K. 10
L. 11

9. If sizeof(int) is 4 bytes, and sizeof(int*) is 8 bytes,
   how much memory does myMatrix occupy (that is, what
   is sizeof(myMatrix) )?

A.   4 bytes.
B.   8 bytes.
C.  24 bytes.
D.  32 bytes.
E.  48 bytes.
F.  64 bytes.
G.  72 bytes.
H. 108 bytes.
I. 144 bytes.


For the next three questions, suppose you instead declared:
  int m0[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
  int m1[4] = {4, 5, 6, 7};
  int m2[4] = {8, 9, 10, 11};
  int * myMatrix[3] = { m0, m1, m2 };

0. Again, assuming sizeof(int) is 4 bytes, and sizeof(int*) is 8 bytes,
    how much memory does myMatrix *alone* occupy (that is, what
    is sizeof(myMatrix)) ?

A.   4 bytes.
B.   8 bytes.
C.  24 bytes.
D.  32 bytes.
E.  48 bytes.
F.  64 bytes.
G.  72 bytes.
H. 108 bytes.
I. 144 bytes.

11. How much total space is used to store myMatrix
    and the data it points to? (that is, what is
    sizeof(myMatrix) + sizeof(m0) + sizeof(m1) +
    sizeof(m2)) ?

A.   4 bytes.
B.   8 bytes.
C.  24 bytes.
D.  32 bytes.
E.  48 bytes.
F.  64 bytes.
G.  72 bytes.
H. 108 bytes.
I. 144 bytes.

12. Which of the following is true this newer declaration of
    myMatrix which is not true of the declaration used in
    questions 7--9?

A. myMatrix[0][0] is an lvalue.
B. myMatrix[0] is an lvalue.
C. myMatrix is an lvalue.
D. myMatrix[0][0] is an rvalue.
E. myMatrix[0] is an rvalue.
F. myMatrix is an rvalue.
G. None of the above.

13. A program's instructions are stored in memory as

A. Numbers
B. Symbolic identifiers
C. Assembler mnemonics
D. None of the above

14. Which of the following declares g to be a pointer
    to a function which returns a double, and takes two
    ints as parameters?

A. double funptr(int,int) g;
B. funptr(int,int)->double g;
C. double g(int, int);
D. double (*g) (int,int);
E. None of the above.

15. If you declared p as a function pointer
    of an appropriate type, and did

  p = main

where would p point?

A. At the first variable in main's frame.
B. At the first string literal used by main.
C. At the first instruction in main.
D. At the first argument passed to main.

6. You learned about the qsort function, which
    takes a function pointer as one of its
    parameters.  What does qsort use this
    parameter for?
A. It calls the passed in function to find
   each element in the array it supposed to sort.
B. It calls the passed in function to compare
   pairs of elements from the array it is supposed to sort.
C. It calls the passed in function to move
   an element to a new position in the array.
D. None of the above.


17. You learned that buffer overflows are a

    learned all along is at the heart of how these work?
