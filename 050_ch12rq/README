As always, read and understand Chapter 12, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. Where does malloc allocate memory?

A. On the stack
B. In the heap
C. In the data segment
D. In the text segment
E. None of the above

2. What does realloc do?

A. Repeats a previous allocation request.
B. Resizes a previously allocated block.
C. Retries a previously failed allocation.
D. Recycles a previously allocated block of memory.
E. None of the above.

3. What is the prototype for malloc?

A.  int * malloc(int size);
B.  const int * malloc(int size);
C.  void * malloc(int size);
D.  const void * malloc(unsigned int size);
E.  int * malloc(unsigned int size);
F.  const int * malloc(unsigned int size);
G.  void * malloc(unsigned int size);
H.  const void * malloc(unsigned int size);
I.  int * malloc(size_t size);
J.  const int * malloc(size_t size);
K.  void * malloc(size_t size);
L.  const void * malloc(size_t size);


4. Suppose you want p to point at an array of 16 ints,
   which should be allocated by malloc.
   What is the *best* way to declare and initialize p?


A. int * p = malloc(64);
B. int * p = malloc(16 * 4);
C. int * p = malloc(16 * sizeof(int));
D. int * p = malloc(16 * sizeof(*p));

5. Suppose you have 

struct _xyz_t {
  int x;
  int y;
  int * z;
};

and that ints take 4 bytes and pointers take 8 bytes.

You have

  struct _xyz_t * x1;
  struct _xyz_t * x2;
  //x1 is initialized in here somewhere
  //..
  x2 = x1;


When you execute the line x2 = x1; how many
bytes are copied?

A. 4
B. 8
C. 12
D. 16
E. 20
F. 24
G. 28


6. What does free(NULL) do?

A. Crashes the program
B. Frees all memory that was allocated with malloc
C. Frees the most recently allocated block of memory
D. Frees all unreachable blocks of memory.
E. Nothing

7. Suppose you have the following code:

  int * p = malloc(sizeof(int));
  int * q = p;
  free(p);
  free(q);

What problem does this code exhibit with regards
to the use of free?

A. It leaks memory.
B. It frees a pointer not returned by malloc.
C. It double frees a block of memory.
D. None: it uses free correctly.

8. Suppose you have the following code:

int xcount=0;
char * ptr = malloc(50 * sizeof(char));
if(fgets(ptr, 50, stdin)!= NULL) {
   while(*ptr != '\0') {
      if (*ptr == 'x') {
         xcount++;
      }
    ptr++;
   }
 }
free(ptr);

B. It frees a pointer not returned by malloc.
C. It double frees a block of memory.
D. None: it uses free correctly.

For the next three questions, suppose you have

  size_t sz = X ; 
  char * line = Y;
  getline(&line, &sz, stdin);



9. If Y is NULL, then one of the first
   things that geline will do is

A. malloc X bytes of space.
B. malloc X * sizeof(char) bytes of space.
C. malloc an implementation specific amount of space.
D. use fgets to determine how many bytes of space to malloc, 
   then malloc that much space.

10. If Y is not NULL, then what will getline 
    assume about how much space is available
    to store characters into?

A.  It will assume that there are at least as
    many bytes as the length of the next line
    to read from stdin.
B.  It will assume that there are at least X
    bytes.
C.  It will not make any assumptions, 
    but will instead use sizeof to determine
    how many bytes are available.
D.  None of the above.

11. Suppose that Y is NULL and X is 0. 
    The first line from stdin is "Hello\n"
    After getline returns, which of the following 
    is true?

A. sz will be equal to 6 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold 6 chars with H e l l o \n in it.
B. sz will be equal to 6 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold 6 chars with H e l l o \0 in it.
C. sz will be equal to 7 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold 7 chars with H e l l o \n \0 in it.
D. sz will be at least 6 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold sz chars with H e l l o \n in it.
   The values of any other characters in the array are undefined.
E. sz will be at least 6 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold 6 chars with H e l l o \0 in it.
   The values of any other characters in the array are undefined.
F. sz will be at least 7 and line will point at
   an array malloced to hold 7 chars with H e l l o \n \0 in it.
   The values of any other characters in the array are undefined.
G. sz and line will be unchanged.
H. None of the above.
