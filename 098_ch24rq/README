As always, read and understand Chapter 24, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

For questions 1-4, consider the max heap created by adding
the following items (in this order) to an empty heap:

9, 3, 15, 99, 1, 7, 12, 6

1.  When you inserted 6, it had to be swapped with:

A. 1
B. 7
C. 1 then 3
D. 3
E. 15 then 7
F. 7 then 15
G. 9
H. No swaps were involved.
I. None of the above

2. In array form, the final heap is:

A. 3  6  15 99 1  7  12 9
B. 3  9  7  1  6  12 15 99
C. 99 12 9  7  1  15 6  3
D. 99 15 12 6  1  7  9  3
E. 1  3  6  7  9  12 15 99
F. 1  7  6  99 12 15 3  9
G. None of the above

3. If you were to remove the maximum element, what
   element would temporarily become the root, and need
   to be bubbled down?

A. 1
B. 3 
C. 6
D. 7
E. 9
F. 12
G. 15

4. If you were to add a new element to the original tree 
   (without having done the removal in question 3),
   under what condition would it need exactly two swaps
   as it bubbles up?

A. It is between 7 and 12
B. It is between 6 and 99
C. It is between 3 and 15
D. It is between 15 and 99
E. It is greater than 99
F. It is less than 3
G. None of the above.

5. What property does Huffman coding exploit to compress data?

A. Spatial Locality
B. Different Frequencies of Symbols
C. Abstraction
D. Gaussian Distribution of Hash Results
E. None of the above

6. Huffman compression finds an optimal encoding where...

A. each symbol is encoded in 6 or 7 bits.
B. you are guaranteed to compress the data by at least 10%.
C. no symbol's encoding is a prefix of another's.
D. each symbol's encoding includes an error correction bit.
E. None of the above.

7. The Huffman compression algorithm uses what two data structures?

A. A linked list and a heap.
B. A linked list and a binary search tree.
C. A hash table and a priority queue.
D. A hash table and a binary search tree.
E. A stack and a priority queue.
F. A priority queue and a binary tree.
G. A binary tree and a binary search tree.
H. None of the above.
