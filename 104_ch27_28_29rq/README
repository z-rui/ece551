As always, read and understand Chapters 27, 28, and 29 then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".  Unlike usual, this quiz covers three chapters.

For questions 1--5, consider the following tree:

                      64
                    /    \ 
                   32      72
                  /  \   /   \
                 16  50 68    90
                /      /  \   / 
               8      66  70 80  
                         /  \ 
                        69  71                
For questions 1--3, consider this tree as an AVL tree.
For questions 4--5, consider this tree as a Red/Black tree.
