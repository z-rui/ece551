s always, read and understand Chapter 8, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. Why does the naive_swap function fail?

A. The function is recursive without a base case.
B. The function uses variables x and y but the caller users variables a and b.
C. The printf() statement does not print the correct variables.
D. The function only changes variables only within its own frame.

2. What is a pointer’s value?

A. The value of the lvalue to which it points.
B. The address of the lvalue to which it points.
C. The previous value of the lvalue to which it points.
D. The start of the frame containing the lvalue to which it points.

3. What &x evaluate to *conceptually*?

A. An arrow pointing at the box for x.
B. The value in the box at the end of the arrow in x's box.
C. The value of x.
D. None of the above.

4. What does &x evaluate to *numerically*?

A. The first 32 bits of x.
B. A platform-dependent number of bits from the start of x.
C. The address of x.
D. The contents of memory at address x.

5. For &x to be legal, what must be true of x?

A. x must be a constant.
B. x must be an rvalue.
C. x must be an lvalue.
D. x must be an int.

6. What does dereferencing a pointer mean *conceptually*?

A. Releasing the memory held by a pointer.
B. Following the arrow to the box at its end.
C. Changing where the arrow points.
D. Getting a pointer to something.

7. What is a unary operator?

A. An operator that is used only once before being recycled.
B. An operator that takes one bit of space.
C. An operator that takes only one operand.
D. An operator that combines multiple values into a single value.

8. When the swap function is changed to take pointers
   as its parameters, what fundamentally changes about the code?


A. Nothing: The way the code functions is essentially unchanged.
B. Using pointers expands the scope of the swap function.
C. The swap function now takes locations as parameters instead of values.
D. The frame of swap is no longer destroyed when it returns, allowing main
   to view the altered values.

13. For conceptual drawings, we draw pointers as
    arrows pointing at boxes.  However, some boxes
    have an arrow with a flat head ( -----| ) that
    does not  point at another box.  What value
    does this flat-headed arrow indicate?

A. void.
B. The address of the start of the frame.
C. The address of the start of a the function.
D. A pointer to an unknown location.
E. '\0'.
F. NULL.
G. None of the above.

14. x->y is syntactic sugar for which of the following?

A. *(x.y)
B. x.*y
C. (*x).y
D. x.y**
E. None of the above


15. What does "const int x;" mean?

A. x is an integer which should be constantly evaluated.
B. x is an integer whose value may never be changed.
C. x is an integer whose value is constantly changing.
D. None of the above.

16. What does it mean to say "x and *p are aliases".

A. x and *p have the same value.
B. x and *p are both stealth variables.
C. x and *p are two names for the same box.
D. x and *p reside in the same frame.
E. None of the above.

17. Suppose we have a platform with 64-bit doubles, and 32-bit ints.
    We write the following (horrible) code:

    double d = 3.14159;
    int * p = (int*) &d;
    *p = 42;
    printf("%f\n", d);

What would you expect the behavior to be?

A.  It would print 42.0
B.  It would crash on the second line (int * p = (int*) &d;)
C.  It would crash on the third line (*p = 42;)
D.  It would print something near 3.14159, but with some of 
    the least significant digits altered.
E.  None of the above.
