As always, read and understand Chapter 4, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".

1. If you struggle with Step 3, which of the following is a good strategy?
     1. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with more examples.
     2. Make a table
     3. Skip Step 3 and start writing code
A. 1, 2, and 3
B. 1 and 2
C. 1 and 3
D. 2 and 3
E. 1 only
F. 2 only
G. 3 only
H. None of these

2. When you have almost-similar steps,  it is important to find the pattern
   that lets you express them as repetition of the same step.
   Which of the following is NOT a reason why this is important?

A. Repetition will let you avoid testing your algorithm.
B. Repetition will let you generalize over how many times those steps are executed.
C. Repetition will let you express the code as a loop.
D. None of the above (all are reasons).


3. What percent of your time spent creating code should be spent planning?

A. 15%
B. 40%
C. 65%
D. 90%

4. Why should you draw a picture/diagram as you solve a problem?

A. Incorporating different avenues of processing brings more concentration.
B. Creative problem solving can only be done visually.
C. Clear and precise pictures allow you to visualize the state of the problem
   as you manipulate it.
D. Pictures slow down your thought process, allowing you to think more deeply.

5. Which of the following are the two important considerations described
   for Step 2?

     I.   What to name your functions
     II.  How you represent your problem with numbers.
     III. The names, types, and scopes of the variables you will use.
     IV.  What exactly you did, in a step-by-step-fashion.

A. I an II
B. I and III
C. I and IV
D. II and III
E. II and IV
F. III and IV


6. In the example of an algorithm to sum a list of numbers,
   why was the previous_total initialized to 0?

A. Because you always initialize a variable to 0.
B. Because you initialize a variable to 0 whenever you are using it
   to compute on a list of items.
C. Because zero is the identity element for addition.
D. Because zero times any other number is zero.

7. What is a good rule of thumb for when to abstract code out into
   a separate function?

A. When you encounter a step in your algorithm which cannot be directly
   and easily translated into one or two lines of code.
B. When your code has exceeded 50 statements.
C. When the cyclomatic complexity of the code exceeds 100.
D. When you have declared more than 20 variables.

8. What is "top down design"?

A. Developing the algorithm and then writing code.
B. Starting from the big picture of the code, and then developing test cases.
C. Taking code given to you by your boss or technical lead, and making it work.
D. Generating sub-problems to solve as you encounter complex steps in the
   higher-level problem.

9. When is switch-case preferable to if-else?

A. When there are more than 3 possible choices.
B. When you are evaluating conditions on strings.
C. When making a decision based on many possible numeric values.
D. When you do not need to use any short-circuiting boolean operators.

10. What code construct is the most appropriate translation for
    algorithmic steps which call for updating the values of variables?

A. Conditional Statements.
B. Loops.
C. Return Statements.
D. Assignment Statements.
