As always, read and understand Chapter 5, then answer these questions 
in "answers.txt".

1. What does the compiler do?

A. Determines if a program is bug-free or not.
B. Converts a program from human-readable source code to machine-readable
   instructions.
C. Generates test cases to cover infrequent cases.
D. Ensures that results from running the program are replicable.

2. What is a function prototype?

A. A declaration which informs the compilers of the name, return type,
   and parameter types of a function which is defined elsewhere.
B. An implementation of a function suitable for inclusion in a library.
C. A function which is used by many different programs.
D. A part of the preprocessor which handles #define directives.

3. What tool is useful for building large programs with many source files?

A. make
B. emacs
C. gcc
D. valgrind


4. Which part of the compiler combines object files, libraries, 
   and startup code to make an executable binary?

A. preprocessor
B. parser
C. assembler
D. linker

5. What is in an object file?

A. The source code in an object-oriented programming language.
B. Java Object Descriptors.
C. Machine-executable instructions.
D. A description of which objects are required to assemble the code.

6. Which header file defines EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE?

A. stdio.h
B. stdlib.h
C. stdint.h
D. unistd.h

7. What is the return value from main used for?

A. It is always ignored.  You always put "return EXIT_SUCCESS;"
B. The compiler checks it to see if there were any errors.
C. Valgrind examines it to determine which variables were uninitialized.
D. It informs the program which ran this program of its success or failure.


8. What does the -o option to gcc do?

A. Specifies that gcc should only make an object file.
B. Specifies the name of the output that gcc should produce.
C. Specifies an advanced/unusual option by name.
D. Specifies the language standard to use.

9. If your code needs to make references to the largest value
   an integer can hold, why should you use INT_MAX rather than
   writing 214783647?

A. Portability
B. Reduce risk of mistakes
C. Readability
D. All of the above.

10. If you have multiple compiler errors, what difficulties might you
    encounter in trying to fix the later errors?

A. Fixing compiler errors is hard in general.
B. The compiler may be confused by the earlier errors.
C. The compiler only gives line numbers for the first error.
D. None of the above.
