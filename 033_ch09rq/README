  int p[4];

Then the highest valid index in p is

A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
E. 4
F. 5


2. If arr is an array, then arr[x] is 
   equivalent to


A. *arr + x
B. arr + *x
C. arr + x
D. *(arr + x)
E. None of the above

3. If arr is an array, then &arr[x] is 
   equivalent to


A. *arr + x
B. arr + *x
C. arr + x
D. *(arr + x)
E. None of the above

4. What is a dangling pointer?

A. A pointer to an uninitialized value.
B. A pointer which has been cast to an inappropriate type.
C. A pointer whose type has more *s than required.
D. A pointer to something whose memory has been deallocated.
E. A pointer to an array with insufficient space for the data
   it needs to store.
F. None of the above.

5. Suppose that p is a dangling pointer, and you do

     *p = 3;

   What will happen?

A. The program will crash immediately.
B. Something's value will change, but it is difficult to say what.
C. The compiler will give you an error.
D. Nothing bad will happen. 

6. What is the most correct type to use for the size or index
   of an array?

A. int
B. unsigned int
C. long
D. unsigned long
E. size_t
F. None of the above

7. Suppose you had a function

  int myFunction(int * array) {
   //some code
  }

How can myFunction determine the number of elements in array?

A. sizeof(array)
B. sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0])
C. Call the appropriate C library function.
D. None of the above.

8. Suppose the array parameter were instead declared int[] array:

  int myFunction(int array[]) {
   //some code
  }

In this situation, how can myFunction determine the number of elements in array?

A. sizeof(array)
B. sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0])
C. Call the appropriate C library function.
D. None of the above.

9. Suppose I wrote

 int data[] = {2,5,7,9};
 int * p = &data[1];
 p++;

What is the value of *p after this code fragment?

A. 2
B. 5
C. 7
D. 9
E. This code does not compile.
F. This code will crash.
G. The behavior is undefined.
H. None of the above.

10. What happens if you write:


 int data[6]  = {0, 1, 2} ;

A. The compiler will give you an error.
B. The compiler will warn you, and leave elements 3,4, and 5 uninitialized.
C. Elements 3, 4, and 5 will be uninitialized (but the compiler will not warn you).
D. Elements 3, 4, and 5 will be initialized to 0.
E. Elements 3, 4, and 5 will be initialized to 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
F. None of the above.
